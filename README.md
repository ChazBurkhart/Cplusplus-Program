# Cplusplus-Program

*<p>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</p>*
<p> In this project I developed an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.</p>

*<p>What did you do particularly well?</p>*
<p> I feel like in this project I got the program to work as intended and to output the results in an aesthetic way. </p>

*<p>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</p>*
<p> My code could be a bit cleaner or more efficient. Also, I could work on my Get and Set methods. I was able to make it work, but not how I had initially planned. </p>
  
*<p>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?</p>*
 <p> The most difficult to write was the calling the same print method and having it print differently depending on what was being input. In the end, I wasn't able to make it work. So I had to have 2 different print methods be called. However, I made a lot of good strides on it. Up until this assignment, my method calling was not great. I feel like I'm adding new tools to my belt all the time. </p>
 
*<p>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? </p>*
 <p> Like I said above, learning methods, especially when I have them on seperate files is a skill I need to know how to do and it's something I've made a lot of progress on. </p>
 
*<p>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </p>*
 <p> This program has a lot of comments in it. I feel like I explained it as well as I can. I tried to make it so that anyone who doesn't know how to code could at least follow along. I feel like there's a lot of room to grow on this program. I think I set good groundwork for expanding and modifying. </p>
